## Airdodges
- Airdodges function similarly to Rivals of Aether, consisting of linear movement in a direction followed by a stall in place and a short period of inactionable fall
- Airdodges are once-per-airtime, they are not returned until after grabbing ledge or touching the ground
- Distances have been normalized, the FAF is based on a characterâ€™s gravity and fallspeed
  - Note that upwards directional airdodges will *not* gain any vertical recovery 
- Gravity takes effect starting on frame 30 of both neutral and directional airdodges
- Directional airdodges retain all momentum upon hitting the ground
- Airdodges can no longer transition directly into techs
- Statistics:
  - Intangibility has been standardized to F4-29
  - Can grab ledge starting on frame 35 for directional airdodge or the FAF for neutral airdodge
  - Max Landing Speed: 2.0 ðŸ š 4.0
  - Landing Lag: 20/10F ðŸ š 10F

## Wavedashes / Wavelands
- Input a directional airdodge during jumpsquat or when within 6.0 units of a ground surface to slide along the ground with a burst of momentum
  - Any angle at or below horizontal will result in a successful wavedash, with steeper angles resulting in less slide
  - Wavedashes can also be performed by pressing jump and shield on the same frame
- While jump is being input, roll and shield cannot be buffered
- Wavedashes can pick up items
- Wavelands will snap to ground surfaces if the characterâ€™s ECB is within 5 units
