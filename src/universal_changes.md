  - Buffer is now active during new cancels (land cancel/hammers etc)

  - C-Stick drift has been completely removed and the macro has been reprogrammed from scratch to mitigate inconsistencies and provide cleaner Bidou/Aidou implementation
  - Buffered airdodges out of hitstun have been disabled
  - Buffered spotdodges/rolls out of wavedash have been disabled, making consecutive wavedashes and buffering shield out of wavedash more consistent
